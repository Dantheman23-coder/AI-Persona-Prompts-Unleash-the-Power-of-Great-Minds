## Additional Persona Prompts

For a broader set of use cases, see the [50 additional prompts](examples/new_persona_prompts.md) that extend this library with voices from science, art, and activism.

## Voice Dictation Persona Prompts

To make the prompts accessible when using voice interfaces, the [voice dictation prompt collection](examples/voice_dictation_prompts.md) condenses each persona into a single sentence that is easy to read aloud or dictate with speech-to-text tools such as Whisper.

## Philosophy & Integrated Protocol Approach
You **create personas as modular tools**; you **operate as one unified OS**.  
This repo is therefore **not** a pile of character imitations.  
It is a **Protocol Library for Reasoning Roles (PLRR)**—a set of cognitive
contracts that any agent (LLM, human, or hybrid) can plug into for **consistent
behavior, ethical alignment, and measurable value**.

| Discipline | Pain-Point            | PLRR Benefit                               |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Medicine   | Diagnostic drift      | Standardised reasoning checkpoints         |
| Education  | Uneven AI literacy    | Plug-and-play pedagogic scaffolds          |
| Public Sec | Policy opacity        | Transparent deliberation steps             |
| Industry   | Tool sprawl           | Cross-agent handshake format               |

> **Key takeaway:** A protocol is a coordination scaffold—not just an API.

## Quick Start (Protocol Edition)
1. **Pick a Role** from `/prompts`.  
2. **Choose a Mode** — `markdown` for chat UIs · `json` for MCP / function calls.  
3. **Inject Context** — your task, data, or agent memory.  
4. **Run → Iterate → Refine** — log insights in `/logs`.

## Agentic Workflow Recipes

### Recipe A · “Evidence Loop” (Medicine)
1 `cds_agent`   → evaluates labs  
2 `generalist_strategist` → option tree  
3 `policy_analyst`        → reimbursement angle  
4 Return composite plan to clinician.

### Recipe B · “Campus Copilot” (Education)
Tutor → Hopper persona for code → merged answer.

### Recipe C · “Rapid-Response Policy Desk”
Policy Analyst draft → Cyber Threat scan → Strategist alignment check.

## Why Instruction-Based Persona Design Drives Alignment
1. **Legibility > Black-Box Power** — traceable steps ease audits.  
2. **Cognitive-Load Shear-Off** — users offload framing without switching
personas.  
3. **Inter-Agent Contract** — uniform format lets MCP hot-swap roles safely.

---

## Contributing Guidelines (Expanded)
* Fork → feature branch → commit using Conventional Commits.  
* One new persona **or** one recipe per PR.  
* Add tests in `/examples/tests/`.  
* English first, Latin optional; line ≤ 120 chars; JSON must parse with `jq`.
